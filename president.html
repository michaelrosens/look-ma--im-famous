                            <p class="subtext testic">The “common man” saw in Jackson a like-minded individual and thus sent him to Washington to take office and crush the power of the aristocrats. Voters trusted Jackson and saw his military accomplishments as an indication he would bring the same success in restoring honor to the government.”</p>

                                <p class="subtext testic">Andrew Jackson’s time as president would mark a major historical shift for the United States. Unfortunately, the first two years of his term were marred by a social scandal that turned political.Before Andrew Jackson took office, his friend and Secretary of War, John Eaton, married Margaret "Peggy" Timberlake. However, Washington socialites disapproved of Peggy due to her questionable upbringing and rumors about her past. The cabinet members' wives refused to associate with her, leading Jackson to defend his friends, as Eaton had supported Rachel Jackson during the 1828 campaign. Jackson demanded acceptance for Mrs. Eaton in Washington's social circles, and this controversy became known as the "Eaton Affair." </p>

                                <p class="subtext testic">More controversy followed, when Jackson removed Indian tribes in the United States to the west of the Mississippi River as one of his reforms. This event was an ethnic cleansing and forced displacement of approximately 60,000 people of the "Five Civilized Tribes" </p>

                                <p class="subtext testic">Jackson’s presidency was filled with controversy. When he vacated office, he left his mark on the presidency and forever changed the course of American history. Through his actions and tenure as president, Jackson squarely set the Executive Branch on an equal footing with Congress in terms of power and ability to shape law and government policies.</p>
